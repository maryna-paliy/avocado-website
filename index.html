    <h1>AVOCADO</h1>
    <p>
      Persea americana, or the avocado, possibly originated in the Tehuacan
      Valley in the state of Puebla, Mexico, although fossil evidence suggests
      similar species were much more widespread millions of years ago. However,
      there is evidence for three possible separate domestications of the
      avocado, resulting in the currently recognized Mexican (aoacatl),
      Guatemalan (quilaoacatl), and West Indian (tlacacolaocatl) landraces.
